            I am a 20 year old computer science student at the University of Queensland. In my free time i enjoy sports, music and gaming. I'm passionate about technology and aspire to become a software developer and make a positive impact in the field.

            My goal:
            Since my early days in Year 7, when I first dipped my toes into the world of coding, I’ve been captivated by the magic of software engineering. The thrill of crafting lines of code that transform abstract ideas into functional applications ignited a fire within me. Back then, it was simple programs—perhaps a basic calculator or a text-based game—that fueled my curiosity. But those humble beginnings laid the foundation for a grand aspiration: to become a software engineer
